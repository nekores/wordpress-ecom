# WooCommerce Shipping REST API (v2 and above)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: REST API v2 is currently in development and is NOT public.**

This directory contains the implementation of REST API v2, which aims to do a rewrite following the new WooCommerce REST API v4 architecture and ensuring compatibility with Core Data.

So far, the AbstractController extends WCShippingRESTController, but we need to extend WC V4 AbstractController instead.And work on a proper initialization system.
